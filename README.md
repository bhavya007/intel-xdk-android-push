# intel-xdk-android-push

`QNimate` folder is the Intel XDK Project. Use `Use Existing Project` to import the `QNimate Project`. Then build the app and install the `.apk` file. 

No need to setup server or keys. I have done everything. 

If you want to see how my server script looks then check in `server/android.php` file.
